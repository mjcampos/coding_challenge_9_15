1) Java basic algorithm:

Implement an ArrayList class of type int using primitive array int[] for internal storage.  Don't need generic type.
Provide constructor, get(int index), and append(int value) methods.  Array should dynamically grow as needed.
Provide delete(int index) method. Trailing elements should be left-shift.
Bonus question:

Provide set(int index, int value), and briefly discuss the implications
Please submit the java class implemented.

2) Frontend Javascript question

# Problem Create the following UI:

Create an empty container div in the HTML file.
Programmatically create multiple child divs in the container, say 10. Use Javascript.
Give all the child divs a black background.
Lay out the child divs horizontally within the container.
Whenever the user clicks one of the child divs, the child div should respond as follows:
If the child div does not have a blue background:
Give the child div a blue background.
Print out the child div's index. If the 7th div is getting a blue background, say "Turning ON 7".
If the child div does have a blue background:
Give the child div it's original background color.
Print out the child div's index. If the 4th div is removing the blue background, say "Turning OFF 4".
# Requirements The solution:

Should work for 3, 10, 27, however many child divs. They do not all need to be on the same line, but they should still lay out horizontally (across multiple lines if necessary).
Combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. # Submission Please include all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with your submission.
Feel free to look online for any HTML/CSS/JavaScript code you don't know but think you need.
Do not search for the problem solution.
